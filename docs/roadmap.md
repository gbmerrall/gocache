# GoCache Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction for GoCache, including potential new features and architectural improvements.

## HTTP/2 Support

Adding full HTTP/2 support is a significant feature that would improve performance, especially for modern web clients. This task can be broken down into two distinct parts with very different levels of effort.

### 1. Proxy-to-Upstream Connection (Low Effort)

This is the connection that GoCache, acting as a client, makes to the origin web server.

*   **Current State:** Go's standard `http.Transport` automatically negotiates HTTP/2 with servers that support it for HTTPS requests. It's likely that this is already happening for some connections without any explicit configuration.
*   **Effort:** **Low (estimated 2-4 hours)**.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Verification:** Add logging to the proxy to inspect the `resp.Proto` field of the response from the upstream server to confirm which protocol (`HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2.0`) was used.
    2.  **Configuration:** Ensure the `http.Transport` used by the proxy doesn't have any settings that would disable HTTP/2.
    3.  **Testing:** Create an integration test that uses an `httptest.NewUnstartedServer` configured to explicitly enable HTTP/2, and then assert that GoCache communicates with it using the correct protocol.

### 2. Client-to-Proxy Connection (High Effort)

This is the connection from the user's browser (or other client) to the GoCache proxy itself.

*   **Current State:** The current HTTPS implementation relies on `http.Hijacker` to take over the raw TCP connection and read a raw HTTP/1.1 request from the decrypted stream. This workflow is fundamentally incompatible with HTTP/2.
*   **Challenge:** HTTP/2 is a binary, multiplexed, frame-based protocol. It cannot be handled with simple stream reading like HTTP/1.1.
*   **Effort:** **High (estimated 3-5 days)**.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Major Refactoring of `handleHTTPS`:** The core of the MITM logic would need to be completely rewritten.
    2.  **Use `golang.org/x/net/http2`:** After the TLS handshake, the `http2` package would be required to serve H2 frames over the hijacked connection. This involves managing individual streams, headers, and data frames.
    3.  **Handle Multiplexing:** A single H2 connection can carry multiple requests and responses (streams) concurrently. The current logic is built around a simple one-request-one-response model and would need to be re-architected to manage the lifecycle of multiple streams over a single connection.
    4.  **Complex Testing:** A new test harness would be required, using an H2-capable client library to connect to the proxy and verify that multiplexed streams are handled correctly.
